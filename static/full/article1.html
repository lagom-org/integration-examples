    <h2>The Mystery of Dark Matter, the Invisible Universe</h2>
    <h3>Thank you for purchasing this article !</h2>

    <p>In the vast expanse of the universe, what we see is just the tip of the cosmic iceberg. Scientists estimate that about 85% of the universe's mass is made up of something mysterious and invisible: dark matter.</p>
    <p>Dark matter doesn't emit, absorb, or reflect light, making it completely invisible and detectable only through its gravitational effects on visible matter, like stars and galaxies. It acts as a cosmic glue, holding galaxies together and influencing their rotation speeds.</p>
    <p>Despite its elusive nature, dark matter is crucial for understanding the universe. Astronomers infer its presence by observing gravitational lensing, where light from distant objects is bent around massive clusters of dark matter, creating distorted or multiple images of the same object.</p>
    <p>Scientists are exploring various theories about dark matter, from weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) to axions, and experiments worldwide are underway to detect these elusive particles directly.</p>
    <p>Unraveling the secrets of dark matter could revolutionize our understanding of the cosmos, shedding light on how galaxies formed and evolved and potentially leading to new physics beyond the current models.</p>
    <p>As we probe deeper into this dark mystery, we edge closer to answering fundamental questions about the universe's composition and the forces that shape it, opening new horizons in our quest to comprehend the cosmos.</p>
